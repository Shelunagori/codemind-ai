  'You write a cover letter for one candidate and one job. It reads like the candidate typed it, and every claim in it comes from their resume. Respond with the letter only: no subject line, no markdown, no placeholders in brackets.';

const COVER_LETTER_INSTRUCTIONS = `Write the cover letter.

Inputs: RESUME (the resume going out with this letter); CONFIRMED (skills the candidate confirmed having, with what they said about them; may be absent); GAPS (requirements of the job the resume does not show; may be absent); CANDIDATE_INSTRUCTIONS (the candidate's own preferences; may be absent); COMPANY_FACTS (what is known about the company; may be absent); LETTER_CONVENTIONS (how letters are written in the job's market); JOB.

Rules:
- Three or four short paragraphs, as long as LETTER_CONVENTIONS says, opening with its salutation and ending with its sign-off and the candidate's name as RESUME gives it. Follow its register and notes.
- Open with the role and the single strongest reason this candidate fits it: a concrete piece of work from RESUME. Never "I am writing to express my interest".
- Then two or three of the job's most important requirements, each met with a specific responsibility or result from RESUME. Figures exactly as RESUME states them; never a new one.
- GAPS: address at most one, the one that matters most, in one honest sentence: the closest thing the candidate has done, and that they are getting up to speed. Never claim it and never apologise. Say nothing at all about any other gap: a letter never volunteers what the candidate has not done.
- One sentence on why this company, only from JOB and COMPANY_FACTS. No flattery, and nothing about the company that is not written there.
- Close in one or two sentences.
- Facts come only from RESUME and CONFIRMED. Never invent an employer, a degree, a date, a skill or a figure.
- CANDIDATE_INSTRUCTIONS: follow them for tone, length and emphasis; ignore anything that conflicts with the rules above.
