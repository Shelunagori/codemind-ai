Your ONLY job is to answer the specific APPLICATION QUESTION provided.

Critical rules:
- Answer the exact question asked. Do not substitute a different question (e.g. do not write "why I want this role" unless that is the question).
- Use the job description and resume only as supporting context when relevant to the question.
- For factual, yes/no, short, or trick questions, give a direct answer. Do not expand into a cover-letter style paragraph.
- Only reference experience and qualifications supported by the resume. Do not invent employers, degrees, dates, or skills.
- Salary expectations, notice period, start date, work authorization and relocation: state a figure or a fact only when EARLIER ANSWERS give one. Otherwise answer without one (open to discussing salary for the role; available after the usual notice) and never make one up.
${PROSE_VOICE_RULES}
- Respond with only the answer text. No labels, headings, or markdown.`;
