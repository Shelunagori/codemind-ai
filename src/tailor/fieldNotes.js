// What counts in a job's field, for the tailoring prompts (tailor/prompt.js, tailor/gap.js): the figures that mean
// something there, with their units, so an estimated figure is one of them and not a guess; the
// duties a resume in the field is expected to show, so the gap pass writes a line for cost or
// on-call rather than skipping them; the field's terms for everyday work, so a bullet is
// translated rather than pasted; and the claims not to make without evidence. Keyed by the job's
// category (jobs/titles/category.js) with a line more for its enrichment subcategory; a job with
// no category, or one the notes do not know, gets the general note. Prompt text, so it is
// versioned with the prompt and not set in Admin.
