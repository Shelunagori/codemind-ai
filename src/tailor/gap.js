Rules:
- One line per gap, as { id, role, from, text, estimate }: "role" is the role it goes in (the most recent role that does that kind of work); "from" is the "i" of the bullet it extends — the bullet that comes closest to the requirement — and "text" the whole bullet as it should now read; or "from" is null and "text" a new bullet, when no bullet comes close.
- No two lines extend the same bullet: the second would overwrite the first. When two gaps fit one bullet, answer both in that one line, or take the next-closest bullet, or a new one.
- The line is a real piece of work, not the requirement said back. It names the specific thing from this role — the product, pipeline, service, dataset, client or release the role's other bullets name — says what was done to it, and how, with the requirement's term as the tool or method used once. The program refuses a line that shares the requirement's words and names nothing of the role's own. Not: "Participated in Agile teams and Software Development Lifecycle practices to iterate over design and development cycles" (the posting paraphrased). But: "Ran two-week sprints for the reporting pipeline with the analytics lead, shipping a release each sprint and reviewing every data-model change." Not: "Used AI-assisted development tools to draft and inspect application code" but: "Drafted the caller-ID service's migration scripts with Copilot, then verified each against the Postgres schema and the existing tests before release." In the same voice and length as the bullets around it: one sentence, under 30 words and ${MAX_BULLET_CHARS} characters (the program refuses a longer one), opening with the action. At most two technologies the bullet did not already name; never a list of tools; never the requirement's adjectives ("judiciously", "strong", "comfortable", "extensive").
- A requirement about the size or kind of organization, years in a field, or a frame of mind ("comfort with ambiguity") is not a line to write: the roles as they stand answer it, or nothing does. Skip it.
- A bullet that ends with a figure clause ("…, cutting failed uploads by ~30%") keeps that clause word for word at its end: the figure is the candidate's to edit, and a line without it is put back with it.
- Nothing the resume does not state: no employer, title, date, team size, customer, certification or number — except a figure for a requirement marked "measured", which the line must state: exactly one figure, realistic and modest (10-30%, with "~" or "about"; or a count or a time — a count or a time rather than another percentage when the role already states two), of the thing the requirement measures, as a clause at the end of the line, copied exactly into "estimate" ("cutting deployment lead time by ~20%"). Two figures in one line, or a bare "~20%" in "estimate", and the line is thrown away. Every other line's "estimate" is "". A bullet that already carries a figure takes no second one, and a figure is not put on the bullet next to one that has a figure: extend it without a figure, or extend another.
- A verdict that says why a line fell short (a bare term, a list of tools, no figure) is fixed on that line: "from" is that bullet.
- A skill gap ("[required skill]") is met by naming the skill in the bullet whose work used it, as the tool it was done with — at most two skills to a bullet, and never a bullet that is a list of them.
- Skip a requirement about years in a field, and one already met by a line you write for another gap. Skip a requirement that names a product, platform or certification the resume shows no sign of (a service mesh, an internal developer platform, a CKA) — that would be inventing a career — and one about a clearance, citizenship or work authorisation. A skill goes on a bullet whose platform and language could have used it, never on one about another (no XCTest on an Android bullet). A duty FIELD_NOTES lists, which anyone operating the resume's own systems would have done — cost, on-call, monitoring targets, incident follow-up — gets a line about those systems; a measured one gets one of the field's measures.
