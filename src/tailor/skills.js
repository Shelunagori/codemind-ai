// ── Skills: relevance and count ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A skills section longer than the experience reads as keyword stuffing, and the model, told to
// drop what the job does not need, kept all 82 of one resume's skills and added seven. So the
// cut is code's: what the job names first, in the job's own order, then the model's order, at
// most MAX_SKILLS in all (MAX_JOB_SKILLS when the job's own would otherwise be cut, never for
// anything else), at most MAX_OTHER_SKILLS the job does not ask for and MAX_GROUP_OTHERS of them
// in a category — the categories that name something the job asks for take theirs first, so a
// DevOps job's Cloud category keeps Docker and Linux before a database category keeps Firebase.
// A category with nothing the job names stays only when the model ranked it among the first
// LEADING_GROUPS. A category left with one skill reads as a leftover ("Testing: Monitoring", on
// a resume whose Testing category had seven), so one the job's own skills leave alone takes a
// second — the model's next for it, else the resume's own from that category — before the other
// categories fill, and one the fill leaves alone with a skill the job does not ask for goes.
// Soft skills, job titles and leftover labels ("Languages:") are never skills. A skill the
// rewrite added stays only when the job lists it, the user confirmed it, or the skill dictionary
// knows it: the rest are activities and job-ad phrases ("code reviews", "Token economics"). A
// term written in on assumption — asked for by the job, never confirmed — is a skill only when
// the dictionary knows it: the skills list is a bare claim, and "wire" or "instant payment
// networks" under Other is the posting's wording, not a skill. Repeats go, after a trailing dash
// is stripped ("Github Actions-"), by what the dictionary resolves them to ("Go", "Golang"), and
// by the skill a phrase names ("Terraform modules" beside "Terraform"). Every skill of the
// resume's own that is cut is reported, for the user to put back.
