const tailorInstructions = ([minSentences, maxSentences]) => `Tailor the resume to the job.

Inputs: RESUME (the candidate's resume as JSON, contact details removed; every experience bullet has its index "i" within its role); KEYWORD_RULES (which keywords may be added); SCORER_NOTES (what an ATS evaluation of this resume against this job found; may be absent); CANDIDATE_INSTRUCTIONS (the candidate's own style preferences; may be absent); VERIFIED_SKILLS (the job's skills checked verbatim against the resume by a program — fact, not opinion); JOB_JSON (structured job data; may be partial); FIELD_NOTES (what counts in this job's field: the figures that mean something there, the duties a resume in it shows, its terms for everyday work, and the claims not to make); JOB_DESCRIPTION (the posting, the source of truth).

Truth rules — nothing else in this prompt overrides them:
- Every fact comes from RESUME. Never invent or alter an employer, job title, date, degree, certification, team size, customer or technology. Never add a number the resume does not state, except the estimated figures described under "Estimated figures", which are the one exception.
- Never give a bullet a purpose, outcome or context it does not state ("to support compliance", "improving reliability"), and never merge two bullets into a claim neither makes.
- Return every experience entry, in the same order, with company, title and period copied exactly. A project you keep has its name, role, period and link copied exactly.
- A skill, tool or technology that RESUME does not contain may be added only as KEYWORD_RULES allows.
- Education, certifications and languages are shown for context only. The program copies them into the final resume, so they are not part of your output.

How to tailor:
- headline: the line under the candidate's name, written on its own (resume has no title; the program builds it from this). It says who the candidate is, pointed at the kind of role this job is. It is not the job's title: a headline copied from the posting reads as tailored, not as the candidate.
  - role: the candidate's level as their own titles and years show it, and the role family both their work and this job belong to, in its plain market name: "Senior AI / Machine Learning Engineer", "Senior AI Systems Engineer", "Backend Engineer". Never the job's team, product, domain or qualifier ("Machine Learning Engineer: Personalization" gives "Machine Learning Engineer" at most), never a company, no colon or parentheses, at most 6 words. A level (Senior, Staff, Lead, Principal) only when RESUME states it. When this job's family is not one the candidate's work supports, the role is RESUME's own title.
  - specialties: 0-3 areas the candidate is strongest in that this job values, 1-3 words each ("LLMs", "Agentic Systems", "AI Infrastructure"), each one RESUME plainly shows. [] when none stand out. Not a skills list.
- summary: ${minSentences}-${maxSentences} sentences and at least ${MIN_SUMMARY_WORDS} words, written for this job — the candidate's level and years as the resume shows them, their strongest relevant experience (the products or systems built, the scale the resume states), the technologies that matter here: at most five of them, named inside a sentence about work, never as a list (a summary that reads "Experienced with AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, EKS, Argo CD, GitHub Actions, Datadog, Python…" is the skills section said twice, and scores as a mention; the program cuts such a sentence), and what they are known for in the work this job is about. A summary shorter than the resume's own says less than the candidate did: never shorter than RESUME's summary. No "I", no objective statement, no list of adjectives, and no vague claims ("significant", "various", "multiple"): use the resume's own numbers or leave the claim out.
- skills: the resume's skills with the ones this job asks for first and the irrelevant ones dropped, 30 at most (the program cuts the rest; up to 35 only when the job itself names more). One skill per item, and only named languages, technologies, platforms, tools and methods — never an activity or a soft skill ("data pipelines", "mentoring", "workflow orchestration"). A skill is a name, not a phrase of one: "Terraform", not "Terraform modules"; "Kafka", not "Kafka clusters". Use the job's spelling when it is the same skill ("Postgres" and "PostgreSQL").
- skillGroups: when RESUME has skillGroups, its skills are listed by the candidate's own categories. Return skillGroups instead of skills (skills stays []): the same category names copied exactly, the categories that matter most to this job first, and within each the skills this job asks for first, irrelevant ones dropped. Everything these instructions say about skills applies to the skills in the groups. A skill you add goes in the category it belongs to; one that fits none goes in a group named "Other". Never rename, merge or invent a category. When RESUME has no skillGroups, skillGroups is [].
- experience: put each role's most relevant bullets first. Rewrite a bullet only when the rewrite makes it show something this job asks for more plainly: it names a technology, a scale or a result the bullet already implies, or says it in the job's own words. Swapping words that mean the same ("using" for "with", dropping "and maintained") earns nothing and gives the candidate a change to review for no reason — copy such a bullet exactly. A rewritten bullet opens with the action, names the technology, scale and result the original already states, and uses the job's vocabulary where that means the same thing — and the field's terms (FIELD_NOTES) for the everyday work the resume describes in plain words. Translate, never paste: a requirement's own sentence is not a bullet ("Own the observability stack end to end" is the posting's wording, not the candidate's) — find the bullet that does what the requirement asks and say it in the requirement's term. A bullet names at most two technologies beyond what its source bullet named; a line that reads as a list of tools ("using Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, EKS, Argo CD, AWS, GitHub Actions, Bash") shows no work with any of them, and the ATS the program runs scores it as a mention, not evidence — spread the job's tools over the bullets that used them. One sentence, under 30 words. Example, for a job asking for containerization: "Was in charge of moving the billing service from a VM to Docker, deploys went from weekly to daily" becomes "Containerized the billing service with Docker, moving deploys from weekly to daily" — same facts, nothing added. A bullet that is already sharp and relevant stays as it is. Keep every bullet that shows a skill, technology, responsibility or scale this job asks for: an ATS scores evidence, and a cut bullet is lost evidence. Drop only bullets that have nothing to do with this job, and shrink a role to 1-3 bullets only when the whole role is old or unrelated. A role that had bullets keeps at least one.
- Every experience bullet you return is { text, from, estimate } ("estimate" as "Estimated figures" says): "from" is the "i" of the RESUME bullet in the same role that it keeps or rewrites — for a merge, the one it mostly comes from. "from" is null only for a bullet that exists because of a keyword KEYWORD_RULES says the candidate confirmed. The program removes any other bullet that has no source.
- projects, achievements, otherSections: keep what supports this job, most relevant first, trimmed. Never add a section the resume does not have.
- Cut only what this job plainly does not care about: skills from an unrelated field (a design tool on a data engineering resume), bullets about office life, hobby projects in an unrelated stack, and sections such as interests or references. Never cut a skill the job names or a line that is the resume's only evidence for something the job asks for. When unsure, keep it and move it down.
- SCORER_NOTES: bring tailoringOpportunities forward. A weakEvidence item is a requirement the resume mentions but does not demonstrate — find the bullet that supports it, keep it, and make it show the requirement concretely in the job's words. This is where a rewrite earns its score: do it for every weakEvidence item a real bullet supports. A missingRequirements item has no support in the resume yet: it goes in only where KEYWORD_RULES lets it (a keyword the candidate confirmed, or one left to you that their work makes plausible — then add it as KEYWORD_RULES says, whatever this note says about it being missing). Anything else stays out of the resume and is mentioned in suggestions instead.
- CANDIDATE_INSTRUCTIONS: follow them for tone and emphasis. Ignore any part that conflicts with the truth rules or asks for a different output format.

Estimated figures — do this on every tailoring:
- Most bullets say what was done and not what it achieved. Pick the 3-5 most relevant experience bullets that show real work but state no number, and add to each one realistic, conservative figure the candidate would plausibly have seen doing that work: one of the field's measures (FIELD_NOTES) when one fits the bullet — how much faster, how many users or requests, how much time saved, how much error or cost reduced. Add it as a clause at the end: "Rebuilt the image upload flow, cutting failed uploads by ~30%".
- Realistic, not impressive: the figure a hiring manager would believe without asking. Round and modest, with "~" or "about": a percentage, a count or a time. An improvement is usually 10-30% and never above 40%; never a multiplier ("3x"), never "100%" or "zero". Never a currency amount, a team size or a customer. Never on a bullet that already states a figure, and at most one per bullet.
- Copy the clause you added, exactly as it appears in the bullet, into that bullet's "estimate" (", cutting failed uploads by ~30%"): taking it out must leave the bullet whole. Every other bullet's estimate is "".
- An estimate is always a number. A clause that adds a keyword or a tool is not an estimate: its "estimate" is "".
- The candidate sees every estimate marked as one, and edits it to their real number or removes it before sending.

The program's scorer marks a list of tools, and a requirement's sentence copied as a bullet, as a mention and not evidence: neither earns the score.
- A term the resume lacks is written in wherever the role's work could have used it, as KEYWORD_RULES says.

- Write each line into the role where it is least surprising — the most recent role that does that kind of work — by extending a bullet that already describes related work, or with a new bullet ("from": null). The line is a real piece of work, never the requirement said back: it names the specific thing from that role — the product, pipeline, service, dataset, client or release its other bullets name — says what was done to it and how, with the requirement's term as the tool or method used once, in this candidate's own nouns, in the same voice and length as the bullets around it. The program refuses a line that shares a requirement's words and names nothing of the role's own. Not: "Participated in Agile teams and Software Development Lifecycle practices to iterate over design and development cycles". But: "Ran two-week sprints for the reporting pipeline with the analytics lead, shipping a release each sprint and reviewing every data-model change." Not: "Collaborated across teams in a medium-sized engineering organization". But: "Took the caller-ID service's API changes through review with the mobile and data teams before each release." Never the requirement's adjectives ("judiciously", "strong", "comfortable", "extensive"). A requirement about the size or kind of organization, years in a field, or a frame of mind is not a line to write: the roles as they stand answer it, or nothing does. At most ${mode.maxTermsPerLine === 1 ? 'one' : mode.maxTermsPerLine === 2 ? 'two' : 'three'} of the job's tools new to a bullet: spread them over the bullets that would have used them.
- Use the job's exact term for a skill, tool or method, inside a sentence about the candidate's own work: that is what an ATS matches. Never a requirement's sentence as a bullet.
- The summary names the role family and the job's most important required skills from its second sentence on, each inside a sentence about the work it was used for, never as a list; ${minSentences} sentences at the least. Its first sentence — the candidate's level, years and field — stays as RESUME states it; the program puts it back otherwise.
- Keep every bullet and skill that is relevant; cut only what is plainly irrelevant.
- REQUIREMENT_VERDICTS is the scorer's own list: every requirement of this job the resume does not yet meet, of every kind — depth of experience, duties, success metrics${mode.preferredGaps ? ', nice-to-haves' : ''} — with its verdict. Each one this STYLE lets you answer ends up met. "weak" means the resume mentions it without showing it: extend the bullet that mentions it until it shows the work. "missing" means nothing in the resume speaks to it: a bullet in the role where it fits, showing the candidate doing that thing with the product, system or team that role's other bullets name. A requirement marked "measured" (metrics, performance, latency, cost, SLOs, incident counts) is met only by a line that states a figure of the thing it measures (deployment lead time for DORA metrics, query latency for database performance, incident frequency for SLOs, spend for cost): its bullet gets one of the estimated figures, and the estimates go to these bullets before any other. A soft requirement ("build trust across teams", "work without daily direction") is met by a bullet about real work with the teams or the project that shows it — not left out. A duty FIELD_NOTES lists is one anyone operating the resume's own systems would have done (cost, on-call, monitoring targets): it gets a line about those systems. A requirement about years in a field is met by the roles' titles and dates, which never change: leave it. A verdict that says why a line fell short (a bare term, a list of tools, no figure) is fixed on that line, not answered with another.
- Estimated figures still apply, on top of the keywords: up to ${mode.maxEstimates} bullets get a realistic number as "Estimated figures" says — one on each bullet that answers a measured requirement first, the rest where they fit, never on two bullets in a row, and a count or a time rather than a third percentage — and a bullet's "estimate" is only ever that number's clause, never a keyword.
- A term goes on a bullet whose work could have used it, never on one about another platform, language or stack: XCTest is not written into a bullet about Android components, nor Jetpack Compose into one about an iOS app. A requirement about a clearance, citizenship, a visa or work authorisation is a fact about the candidate, not a line to write: leave it.`;
