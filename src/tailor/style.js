// How far tailoring goes for the score. The user picks (client lib/tailorStyle.js), and a
// request that names no style gets the balanced one. The three run the same pipeline — a
// rewrite steered by the scorer's verdicts, new terms and new bullets allowed, then gap passes
// until the score reaches the mode's target — and differ in how far they lean towards the
// score or towards a line a reader would believe:
//   ats        the score first: aims above 95, writes in what an open verdict needs whether or
//              not the resume's work makes it plausible, within the widest caps.
//   balanced   the default: aims above 90, writes in what the resume's own stack makes
//              plausible and leaves the rest open.
//   realistic  looks real first: aims above 80, writes in only a term the resume's own lines
//              nearly name already, one new bullet a role at most.
// None invents an employer, a title, a date, a degree or a figure, and everything any of them
// adds is listed for the user to remove.
