/**
 * Tailor `form` (the source resume's structured form) for `job` (with its `requirements`).
 * `originalText` is everything the source resume says (its upload's text and its form), which
 * decides what it already has. `scoring` is its cached score for the job; without one it is scored
 * first, because the scorer's findings steer the rewrite. `confirmedKeywords` (missing keywords the
 * user says they have; null when not asked) limits added keywords to those, and `evidence` is what
 * they said about them ([{ keyword, role, note }]). `assumedKeywords` are missing keywords they
 * neither confirmed nor declined, `declinedKeywords` the ones they switched off. `style` is how far
 * the rewrite goes (style.js); `instructions` the user's own notes; `model` the tailoring model.
 * Returns { before, after, tailored, style, confirmed, candidates, assumed, assumedAll, split }.
 *
 * @param {{ form: import('../types.js').ResumeForm, originalText: string, job: import('../types.js').Job, scoring?: import('../types.js').Scoring | null, confirmedKeywords?: string[] | null, assumedKeywords?: string[], declinedKeywords?: string[], evidence?: object[], style?: import('../types.js').TailorStyle, instructions?: string, model: string, meta?: import('../types.js').CallMeta }} input
