// Each thing the job asks for gets one verdict, worth a fixed share of its category. Skills are
// judged in code alone: shown in a line of work, only listed, or absent. For the requirements the
// model gives a verdict and a quote, and code throws out a quote the resume does not contain and
// caps a years requirement at what the dates support. Verdict-with-quote checking follows
// ai-job-hunter-app's evidence grounding (Apache-2.0), pipeline/resume/stages/evidence.rs and
// verbatim.rs.
